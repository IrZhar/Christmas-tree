Graphics and Array Tic-Tac-Toe game
===========================

Develop a graphical version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using array structures. Two players (X and O) will choose open spaces on the 3x# board, and the game ends when one player places three pieces in a continuous vertical, horizontal or diagonal line, **or** when all 9 spaces are occupied (ie. a draw).

1. Create a board with 1 or 2-dimensional array of JButtons
2. Do not allow the players to place piece in occupied spaces
3. The game is over when a player gets a horizontal, vertical or diagonal win
4. Do not let the players place any more pieces once the game has ended
5. Assign the computer to be 'O'
