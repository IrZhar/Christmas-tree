Conditional Looping
================

Create an application to implement a guessing game where the user must enter numbers between 1 and 100 to guess the correct randomly selected number. 

Feedback during the game:

1. When the input number is outside of the correct range, "Number must be between 1 and 100"
2. When the input number is higher than the answer, "Too high!!"
3. When the input number is lower than the anwswer, "Too low!!"
4. When the input number is -999, "Good-bye" and end game
5. When the guess is correct, "Congratulations! It took you Z guesses! That is a score of ##%. Your previous best was Y% and your previous was Z%"
6. When the guess is correct, "Play again?" and repeat the game if the input is Yes/yes/Y/y
